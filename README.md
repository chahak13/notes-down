# notes-down
  The *getNotes.py* file uses the _BeautifulSoup_ module and checks the folder provided by the user as the *folderURL* argument in the main function. The *intranetSpider()* function then checks the folder on the intranet and downloads all the files that were not present in the folder on the users' computer. It also shows a notification to the users' computer (supports Ubuntu only at the moment) about the files that have been downloaded and the location it is downloaded to.
